/**
 * Install packed tarballs into a throwaway consumer outside the repository and
 * drive the installed executable with plain Node.
 *
 * Every tarball the installed tree needs comes from `--from`, so the only
 * registry traffic is for external dependencies. That matters beyond hermetic
 * verification: the harness packages declare the vendored framework as a peer,
 * those packages live in another release sequence, and this job must not depend
 * on the registry already carrying versions that match — one pull request may
 * bump both families before either publishes — so a dsh verification passes the
 * vendored family's pack output too, while publishing only its own
 * ([rationale](../../.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-10-npm-release-sequences.md)).
 *
 * What this proves is that `files` selected a complete payload and that the
 * published dependency ranges resolve. A workspace link or a stale `lib/` in the
 * checkout cannot stand in for a missing file here.
